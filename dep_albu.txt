ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
tables 3.8.0 requires blosc2~=2.0.0, which is not installed.
tables 3.8.0 requires cython>=0.29.21, which is not installed.
gensim 4.3.0 requires FuzzyTM>=0.4.0, which is not installed.
numba 0.57.1 requires numpy<1.25,>=1.21, but you have numpy 1.26.4 which is incompatible.

numpy == 1.24
